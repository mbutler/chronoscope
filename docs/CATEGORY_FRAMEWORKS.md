# Rethinking Timeline Categories: Novel Scholarly Frameworks

Exploring categorization systems that avoid Euro-centric bias and offer fresh perspectives on human history.

---

## The Problem with Traditional Categories

### Why "Continents" Fails:
```
Europe:    15,000 events ████████████████
Asia:       8,000 events ████████
Africa:     3,000 events ███
Americas:   2,000 events ██
```
**Problem:** Reflects archival bias, not historical importance. More European records ≠ more important history.

### Why "Politics/Science/Culture" Fails:
- **Western academic divisions** (not universal)
- **Science** as separate from culture is a modern Western concept
- **Politics** vs. **Religion** = false dichotomy in most societies
- Categories overlap constantly

### Why "Civilizations" Fails:
- **Fuzzy boundaries** (when does "Rome" become "Byzantium"?)
- **Ignores interconnections** (Silk Road, trade networks)
- **Reifies nations** (treats them as natural, inevitable)
- **Leaves out** nomadic peoples, stateless societies

---

## Framework 1: Universal Human Activities

**Based on:** What humans DO across all cultures and times

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Features:

✅ **Universal** - Apply to any culture, any time  
✅ **Interconnected** - Events can span categories  
✅ **Non-hierarchical** - No category more "important"  
✅ **Avoids Euro-centrism** - Based on human activities  
✅ **Archaeologically grounded** - Works for preliterate societies  
✅ **Scalable** - Works from Paleolithic to present

## Alternative: User-Defined Facets

**Most flexible approach:**

Instead of fixed categories, use **tags/facets** that users can filter:

```typescript
interface Event {
  title: string;
  date: Date;
  
  // Multiple tags
  activities: ['subsistence', 'technology', 'governance'];
  scale: 'local' | 'regional' | 'global';
  regions: ['near-east', 'mediterranean'];
  archaeological: ['architecture', 'text', 'burial'];
  
  // Network connections
  connectedTo: ['evt_123', 'evt_456'];
  partOfNetwork: 'silk-road-trade';
}
```

**User controls:**
```

│    ☐ Governance events                                      │
│                                                               │

│  Scale:                                                      │
│    ○ Local   ● Regional   ○ Global                          │
│                                                               │
│  [Apply Filters]                                             │
│                                                               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Benefits:**
- User constructs their own view
- Same event can belong to multiple categories
- No single "correct" taxonomy
- Scholars can debate what tags to use

10. 🔄 Migration & Movement

### Phase 2: Add Scale Layer
Braudel's three timescales as a second dimension

### Phase 3: Add Network View
Show connections between events

### Phase 4: Open Tagging
Let users/contributors add custom tags

---

## Testing the Framework

**Apply to diverse events to see if it works:**

### Test Case 1: Paleolithic Event
**Event:** Cave paintings at Lascaux (17,000 BCE)

**Old categories:** "Art" or "Prehistoric Culture"  
**New categories:** 
- 🎭 Culture & Meaning (primary)
- 🧠 Knowledge & Technology (pigment creation)
- 👥 Social Organization (communal ritual space?)

✅ Works well

### Test Case 2: Non-Western Event
**Event:** Inca khipu record-keeping system (1400s CE)

**Old categories:** "Technology" or "Pre-Columbian"  
**New categories:**
- 🧠 Knowledge & Technology (information storage)
- 👥 Governance (administrative tool)
- 💱 Exchange & Economy (recording tribute)

✅ Works well, not Euro-centric

### Test Case 3: Environmental Event
**Event:** Little Ice Age begins (1300s CE)

**Old categories:** Doesn't fit traditional categories  
**New categories:**
- 🌍 Environment & Ecology (primary)
- 🍽️ Subsistence (crop failures)
- 🔄 Migration (population movements)
- ⚔️ Conflict (resource wars)

✅ Shows interconnections

### Test Case 4: Network Event
**Event:** Zheng He's treasure voyages (1405-1433 CE)

**Old categories:** "Chinese history" (isolates it)  
**New categories:**
- 🔄 Migration & Movement (maritime exploration)
- 💱 Exchange & Economy (trade establishment)
- 👥 Governance (projecting Ming power)
- 🧠 Knowledge & Technology (navigation advances)

Plus network tags: ['maritime-silk-road', 'east-africa', 'southeast-asia']

✅ Shows connections

---

## Conclusion

**Recommended Approach:**

🎯 **Use Universal Human Activities as base categories**

🎯 **Add geographic facets (but make them optional)**

🎯 **Emphasize connections and interactions**

🎯 **Allow multi-category assignment**

🎯 **Include non-human actors (climate, disease, technology)**

This approach:
- Avoids Euro-centrism
- Works across all time periods
- Grounded in scholarly frameworks
- Flexible and expandable
- Shows the complexity of history
